# PROCEDURES

This file works as as a history log and process log for this project. In this file, each and every step related mostly related to commits will be stored.

## Configuring Theme

Since we are using Chakra UI and the app is using dark mode, it is essential to configure the theme early on. The file named `theme.ts` is configured to setup the dark theme for our project.

## Configuring Routes

Since there are gonna be routes in our project because there are multiple sections in the website, we will configure and setup our routes now which will be updated and modified later on.

## Building Auth Page

In this section, we will build our authentication page from scratch using Authentication page that looks similar to the Instagram but with our twist of flavor. We just included a random image for now. The login form will be placed on the right side of the image in the next section.

## Building Authentication Form

Simple form like `Instagram` is made with two login providers: `Google` and `GitHub` . This way, users can login through their github and google profiles. Actual authentication feature will be implemented through `Firebase` authentication.

## Building SideBar Logo Section

First we will build sidebar logo item. The logo item will differ based on the screen size of the viewer. If the device is medium or above, textual logo will be used and for base devices, Icon logo will be used.
