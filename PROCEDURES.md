# PROCEDURES

This file works as as a history log and process log for this project. In this file, each and every step related mostly related to commits will be stored.

## Configuring Theme

Since we are using Chakra UI and the app is using dark mode, it is essential to configure the theme early on. The file named `theme.ts` is configured to setup the dark theme for our project.

## Configuring Routes

Since there are gonna be routes in our project because there are multiple sections in the website, we will configure and setup our routes now which will be updated and modified later on.
